## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the sciDX API on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**(if you plan to use the Docker setup). 
- **Git**
- *CKAN*, we are using the [Docker Compose setup for CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker).
- *Keycloak*, we are using the [official Keycloak on Docker tutorial].(https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker), with the version ```quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:25.0.4```.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the sciDX API repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scidx-api.git
cd scidx-api
```

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment files and adjust the configuration as needed:

   ```bash
   cp ./env_variables/.env_ckan.example ./env_variables/.env_ckan
   cp ./env_variables/.env_keycloak.example ./env_variables/.env_keycloak
   cp ./env_variables/.env_swagger.example ./env_variables/.env_swagger
   cp /env_variables/.env_dxspaces.example ./env_variables/.env_dxspaces

   ```

2. Edit the `.env` files to match your local environment or deployment needs.

### Install Dependencies

#### Option 1: Using Virtual Environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Option 2: Using Docker

1. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the application using one of the following methods:

- **With Virtual Environment**:

  ```bash
  uvicorn api.main:app --reload
  ```

- **With Docker**:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

### Accessing the API

Once the application is running, you can access the sciDX API at:

- **Local environment**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Docker environment**: `http://localhost:8000`

Return to [README](../README.md).

# Enable Staging
To enable beta support for data staging, append the contents of `requirements-staging.txt` to `requirements.txt`. A DXSpaces server must be available to both the sciDX API server, as well as any client in ordere to take full advantage of user query capabilities. Connection information is passed through the `DXSPACES_URL` environment variable. 

The environment variable `DXSPACES_REGISTRATION` controls which registrations are reported to DXSpaces, provided a DXSpaces server is configured. This is a comma-separated list of methods, `all`, or `none`. Supported methods are currently: `url` and `s3`.
