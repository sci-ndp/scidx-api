# Guide to Creating Effective GitHub Issues

Creating well-documented issues on GitHub helps teams communicate effectively about tasks, enhancements, and bugs. An essential part of this process is giving your issue a clear title and categorizing it properly.

## Naming Your Issue:

The title of your issue should be descriptive yet concise. It should give a clear indication of the problem or feature request at a glance. Hereâ€™s a format you might consider using:

- **Bugs**: `[Bug] Short description of the problem`
- **Feature Requests**: `[Feature] Short description of the new feature`
- **Documentation**: `[Docs] Description of the documentation change`
- **Other Types**: `[Type] Description`, where type could be Refactor, Test, Chore, etc.

## Differences Between Issue Types:

- **Bugs**: Issues that report a problem or unexpected behavior in the project. They should include steps to reproduce the issue, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for new features or improvements to existing functionality. Describe what you wish to achieve and why it would be beneficial.
- **Documentation**: Requests or suggestions for improvements to the project's documentation. This can include missing documentation or clarifications on existing content.
- **Others**: This category includes code refactoring, tests, or maintenance tasks that don't necessarily add new features or fix bugs but are essential for project health.

## Creating an Issue:

1. **Navigate to the Issues tab** of the relevant repository and click on "New Issue."
2. **Select a Template** if applicable. Use the appropriate template for bugs, feature requests, or other issue types.
3. **Fill in the Issue Title**: Use the naming conventions mentioned above to provide a clear and concise title.
4. **Describe the Issue** in detail:
   - **Description**: Give a summary of the issue.
   - **Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs): Clearly list the steps to demonstrate the issue.
   - **Expected Behavior**: What should happen?
   - **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens?
   - **Possible Solution**: Suggest a possible fix if you have one.
   - **Additional Context**: Any other information, like screenshots or error messages.
5. **Submit the Issue**: Review the details and submit your issue.

## Simple Issue Template Example
